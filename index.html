        <h1>The Couple</h1>
        <p>
        We met online in 2006. Our first date was over bad food at Alleycatz
        restaurant near Yonge &amp; Eglinton. We were supposed to go to a movie
        but we preferred to keep talking.

        <h1>The Engagement</h1>
        <p>
        Four years later Ian asked Nana aba to stop talking for a second and
        listen. Would she like to be his wife? 
        </p>
        <p>
        YES!
        </p>
        <p>
        We were on the beach in Ghana and Ian brought out a yellow sapphire
        ring. We made a cheesy video soon after which you can see on this page.

        <p>
        We're getting married where we had our first vacation together: Tobago!
        It was where we celebrated Ian's birthday with a great meal of the
        local fish and a relaxing trip to the beach. We're excited to get
        married with a small group of family and friends.
